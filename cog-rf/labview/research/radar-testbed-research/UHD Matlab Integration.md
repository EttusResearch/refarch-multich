## Problem Statement
<!-- 
   Brief description of the feature and the work involved to implement it.
-->
This feature will demonstrate how to integrate UHD driver for USRP with Matlab. It will also show how to perform two types of signal processing algorithms. Doppler phased array processing and reinforcement machine learning are two examples which will be demonstrated.

## Links To Relevant Work Items and Reference Material
<!-- 
   Include links to the work items this design addresses.
   Include links to any other meaningful reference material.
-->

## Implementation / Design
<!-- 
   Describe the implementation and what systems will be affected. Items to consider include:
   * Does this design follow an existing design in the code
   * Does this design create new requirements on clients
   * Does the design have any performance considerations
   * What are unique aspects of this design and how are they going to be handled
   * Are there UX considerations that need to be accounted for
-->

We will implement two example that shows how to call uhd driver and integrate with matlab. One will be with reinforcement learning. Edit by Sastry. 


### Public API changes
<!--
   Describe expected changes to the public API.
	Will any existing APIs be deprecated?
	Will new public APIs be introduced into the core product?
-->

## Alternative Implementations / Designs
<!-- 
   Describe any design alternatives and discuss why they were rejected.
-->

## Open Issues
<!-- 
   Describe any open issues with the design that you need feedback on before proceeding.  It is expected that these issues will be resolved during the review process and this section will be removed when this documented in pulled into source.
