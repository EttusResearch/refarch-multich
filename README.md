# Open Architecture for Radar and EW Research

Welcome to the Open Architecture for Radar and EW Research software distribution. refarch-multich is the free and open-source reference architecture code for building a multi-channel USRP-based Radar and EW Research system, designed by NI.

refarch-multich supports Ubuntu 20.04 with the USRP N320 and USRP N321 Ettus hardware.

## Documentation

For getting started assistance, visit the User Manual located at the [Open Architecture For Radar and EW Research](http://kb.ettus.com/Open_Architecture_For_Radar_and_EW_Research). For technical documentation related to USRPâ„¢ hardware or UHD system design, visit the [UHD and USRP Manual](http://files.ettus.com/manual/).

## OS Support

refarch-multich is developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 version. Operating systems and versions not listed in this document have not been tested and are not officially supported.

## Applications

rearch-multich can be used to build stand-alone Open Architecture for Radar and EW Research system with USRP hardware, or with third-party applications. Some common use-cases for the framework are as follows:

- Cognitive Radar
- Antenna Array
- Beamforming Algorithms 
- Waveform Testing
